\usage{
cbindDS(x.names.transmit = NULL, colnames.transmit = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.names.transmit}{This is a vector of character strings
representing the names of the elemental
components to be combined converted into a transmittable
format. This argument is fully specified by the <x> argument
of {ds.cbind}}

\item{colnames.transmit}{This is NULL or a vector of character
strings representing forced column names for the output object
converted into a transmittable format. This argument is fully
specified by the <force.colnames> argument
of {ds.cbind}.}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument
of {ds.cbind}(or default name <cbind.out>)
which is written to the serverside. Just like the {cbind} function in
native R, the output object is of class matrix unless one or more
of the input objects is a data.frame in which case the class of the
output object is data.frame. As well as writing the output object as <newobj>
on the serverside, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.cbind() also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message}
function. If you type ds.message("<newobj>") it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message("<newobj>")
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".

\description{
serverside assign function that takes a
sequence of vector, matrix or data-frame arguments
and combines them by column to produce a matrix.
}
\details{
A sequence of vector, matrix or data-frame arguments
is combined column by column to produce a matrix
which is written to the serverside. For more details see
help for {ds.cbind} and the native R function {cbind}.
